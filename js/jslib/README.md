# Javascript helpers

Helper libraries, like jQuery, are usually bloated and there is no easy way to select only individual parts you need.

This is a collection of small, stand-alone pieces you can easily combine into a single JS file with the _merge.bat_ script.

They all use a global **"js"** root object as a namespace, for example `js.get_cookie()`.

The code is usually so simple you don't even need any additional documentation.

Feel free to submit your own pieces, provided they are small and beautiful :)
